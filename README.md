 SGX-OpenSSL

unning sample codes
This project contains "Simple SSL/TLS server and client" sample codes.
I hope you can get some hints from the sample applications.

1. If you did not build OpenSSL_SGX library, 
2. Go to SampleCode/Simple_TLS_(Client or Server)/.
3. Type "make" to build SGX-enabled TLS server and client.
4. Start the TLS server at SampleCode/Simple_TLS_Server/app.
5. Start the TLS client at SampleCode/Simple_TLS_Client/app.
